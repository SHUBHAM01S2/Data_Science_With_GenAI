    "### 1. What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n",
    "    - Python is a programming language used in different areas in tech industry. It is developed by guido van rossum in 1991. Python is popular because it provides many features for doing the task. using python we can develop mobile apps, games, web development & data science as well machine learning projects. It provides various libraries for performing different tasks. for e.g Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for Data Visualization and libraries like Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras for performing Machine Learning and Deep Learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What is an interpreter in Python ?\n",
    "    - An interpreter is like a compiler which runs python code line-by-line and convert the high level language code into binary form so that computer or machine can understand that what's going inside the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
    "    - Pre-defined keywords are keywords which are defined by the programmer/developer of the language for performing tasks. so that the programmer use those keywords for performing task instead of writing the whole code.\n",
    "    predefined keywords include:- if, elif, for, is, in, else, while & break, etc they have its special role in programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n",
    "    - No keywords can not be used as variable names. because keywords have there unique work in programming language. if we do that the interpreter does not allow the keywords to work properly and throw errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What is mutability in Python ?\n",
    "    - Mutability in python is of two types:- \n",
    "    1. Mutable:- It means those objects in which we can modify or change there elements after there creation. for e.g lists, sets, etc\n",
    "    2. Immutable:- It means those objects in which we can not modify or change there elements after there creation. for e.g tuples, strings etc\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable  ?\n",
    "    - lists are mutable because we can change there values after there declaration & in tuples we can't change there values/elements after there creation. That's why lists are mutable in nature and tuples are immutable in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n",
    "    - \"==\" is a equality operator which is used to check whether the value_1 is equal to value_2 or not if Value_1 == Value_2 it gives True otherwise False.\n",
    "    - \"is\" is a Identuty operator which is used to compares the identity of two objects, meaning whether they are the same object in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. What are logical operators in Python ?\n",
    "    - logical operators in python are operators which are used for performing logical operations. \n",
    "    examples of logical operators are: - and, or, not.\n",
    "    1. \"and\":- It will print true if both conditions are true otherwise it will print false.\n",
    "    2. \"or\":- It will print true if one of the condition is true as well as both conditions are true then it will print true, otherwise it will print false.\n",
    "    3. \"not\":- It will convert true to false and false to true.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. What is type casting in Python ?\n",
    "    - Type casting is a process of converting the one datatype to an another data type. There are two methods in python for performing type casting.\n",
    "    1. Implicit\n",
    "    2. Explicit\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n",
    "    - The difference between implicit and explicit type casting are:-\n",
    "    1. Implicit Type-Casting:- In this type of type casting the compiler automatically converts the datatype to another datatype for e.g when you add 7+7.7 it will give you 14.7 as an output. where it will treat 7 as a 7.0 after that adds the values and gives 14.7 as an output.\n",
    "    2. Explicit Type-Casting: - In this type of type casting the programmmer manually performing the type casting. for e,g you are making an program which takes input from runtime and after that it will add the numbers:-"

    "### 11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n",
    "    - The purpose of conditional statements in python is to control the execution of the program and makes it more effective according to conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. How does the elif statement work ?\n",
    "    The elif statement in Python is short for \"else if\" and is used as part of an if-elif-else conditional structure. It allows us to check multiple conditions in sequence. Once it finds a condition that evaluates to True, it executes the corresponding block of code and skips the other block of codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n",
    "    - for loop: Used when the number of iterations is known.\n",
    "    - while loop: Used when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
    "    - We'll use while loop in that scenario where we need to find the one condition in all conditions or in simple words it is used when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition.\n",
